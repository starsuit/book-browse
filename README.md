## My thought process

### Why I chose Django:

I do not know much python, and as I had a short timescale in which to build this project I did not feel comfortable building a server in 'vanilla' python. I don't understand the language well enough to know when I would be making fundamental mistakes that would leave the site vulnerable or just broken. I decided that Django would take care of a lot of the lower level processes that I did not feel comfortable writing myself. Following on from this, I had very little idea of how I would get a python site deployed on Heroku, so I looked to their docs. They had an example deployment which used python with Django. I decided that as I was on unfamiliar ground, I would follow a route that had been clearly documented with examples.
